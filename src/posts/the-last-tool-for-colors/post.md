## Colors

Color is one of the most important aspect in any visual design. Colors affect aesthetic, emotion, composition and many other things. Use of right colors can make a design stand out from the crowd. But, picking the outstanding colors is not often easy. It requires years of experience to choose the right color in a design. However, as the era of AI has just begun, it is possible to get the colors using AI tools.

## [Huemint](https://huemint.com)

Huemint is a web-based tool that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest color palettes. It is a time-saving tool for designers who want to quickly generate color schemes for various design projects. Huemint generates color palettes for a variety of use cases, including gradients, illustrations, websites, logos, and more. Its machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to suggest color combinations that are visually appealing and harmonious.

## Generating colors

You can click on **Generate** to generate new set of colors.

How about you like some colors of a palette, but want to change a (or more) color? Well, you can lock your preferred color and hit Generate again to replace the undesired color.

I didn't quite like the 4th color in the above image. So, I locked the rest of the color and clicked generate a few times.

And found as my liking!

## Tweaks

### Presets

You can also choose dominant colors and even contrast with color graph! Try every options yourself and see the results.

## Pitfalls

The AI is perfect is most cases. It only output colors based on the data it was trained on. So occasionally it makes horrible palettes(you'll see). But you can always hit the generate button. Also, selecting colors vary from projects to projects. You still need to be able to recognize well paired colors to select a palette generated by the AI.

There are tons of options to try out, to change, infinite colors to generate in Huemint. So if you need some visually striking colors for you next design project, visit [Huemint](https://huemint.com)
