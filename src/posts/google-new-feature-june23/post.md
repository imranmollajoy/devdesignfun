In a [blog post](https://www.android.com/google-features-on-android/june-2023/), Google has announced new exciting features coming to Android and other devices this month. These features include Nearby Share with Windows PC, new widgets for Google TV, Google Finance, and Google News, Spotify for Wear OS, Reading Practice for Google Play Books, and more.

## Nearby Share for Windows

Nearby Share is a convenient method for sharing files and other content between Android devices. Now it is possible to use Nearby Share with Windows devices. You can try it [here](https://www.android.com/better-together/nearby-share-app/). Please note that it is currently in the beta stage.

## New widgets

Google is adding new widgets for Google TV, Google Finance, and Google News. These widgets will show entertainment suggestions, stock tracking, and curated daily headlines, respectively.

## Spotify for Wear OS

Spotify is now available for Wear OS 2 or later versions. You will be able to listen to songs directly via your smartwatch without picking up your phone. The highlighted Spotify DJ feature requires a Spotify Premium subscription and is currently available only in the US, UK, and Canada.

## Reading practice

This is an effort by Google to help improve the vocabulary and comprehension skills of new readers. Readers who are reading an ebook compatible with Reading Practice will see a Practice button, which reads every word in a sentence out loud. This feature is available in Google Play Books version 8.1 or later.

## Cook new stickers

Emoji Kitchen in Gboard is a feature that allows you to mix different emoji to create new icons. Google is now adding aqua-themed options to the kitchen.
