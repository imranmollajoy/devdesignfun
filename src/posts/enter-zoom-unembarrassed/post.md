Zoom is the ultimate app for online meetings. Zoom is the go-to app for team meetings and online classes. While some use computers, most people, especially students, join classes using their mobile phones. Without some tweaks, the Zoom mobile app directly forces the camera and microphone to open during meetings, which often leads to awkward and embarrassing moments. However, this default behavior can be changed. Let's explore how.

## First step

Open the Zoom app. Once launched, tap the gear icon in the top-left corner to navigate to the settings page.

## Connecting to audio

Entering a meeting and hearing no sound is frustrating. You may assume your device or connection is faulty when, in reality, you just forgot to connect to the audio. To avoid remembering to do this every time you enter a meeting, you can set the audio option to Wi-Fi or mobile data.
